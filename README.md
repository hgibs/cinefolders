cinefolders
===========

[Changelog](https://github.com/hgibs/cinefolders/releases)

For organizing media folders into a structure formatted for Plex, Emby, a flash drive, 
etc..

It tries to reversibly rename files as best it can to follow guidelines set by MediaBrowser
 for [movies](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Movie%20naming) and 
[television](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming). As well as provide a 
link to TheMovieDB for more info. 

If you want to get more info like the trailers, posters, reviews, etc.. Just see the 
sister project to this one: [cinefiles](https://github.com/hgibs/cinefiles).

Note: You'll need a TMDb API Key (I can't just let all of you use mine!) Its easy to get
here: [themoviedb.org api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) Plus once you register 
you can contribute to TMDb! Don't worry, just run `cinefolders` and it'll prompt you for it.
